# Facial Expression Recognition System

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent system capable of accurately recognizing and classifying human emotional states through facial expressions in images or videos. The system leverages modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly Deep Learning, to process and analyze input image data. The goal is to accurately identify common emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutrality.

## Key Features
- **High Accuracy**: The system is designed to achieve precise emotion recognition.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimized for real-time operation, enabling immediate detection and response to emotions as faces appear before a camera or webcam.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: The model is robust yet lightweight, ensuring stability and performance across various common devices.
